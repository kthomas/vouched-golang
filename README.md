# Vouched Golang SDK

This repository contains a Golang implementation of the Vouched API (see https://docs.vouched.id).

The package is not yet feature complete. A list of supported APIs will be documented here.

## Installation

`go get github.com/kthomas/vouched-golang`

Ideally, you should use a package manager such as [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), in which case you can run `glide get github.com/kthomas/vouched-golang`.

Documentation forthcoming.
